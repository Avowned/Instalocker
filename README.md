# Instalocker #
A simple GUI made with CustomTkinter that let's the user instalock an agent on VALORANT

As this is my first ever release, there are bound to be flaws.
I am sorry in advance, please kindly make an 'Issue' report and i'll see what I can do.

## Important ##
- If you want to change the keybind to stop the mouse from Instalocking, go to `bot.py` and in the while loop, you can change the keycode.

- Display Mode: Fullscreen or Windowed Fullscreen
- Resolution: 1920x1080

## How to Use ##
- Select the checkbox of the Agent you want to Instalock
  - (Make sure only 1 checkbox is selected. Unchecking won't cause problems)
- Now when the Agent select screen pops up, your mouse will select the agent you wanted.
- If the mouse is still running even when the agent is selected, just press 'P' and it will turn off.

__It is recommended you restart the program after every Instalock, but it's not required.__
